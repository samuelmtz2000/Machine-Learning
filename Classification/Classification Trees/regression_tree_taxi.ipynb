For more Snap ML examples, please visit [snapml-examples](https://ibm.biz/BdPfxP). Moreover, as shown above, not only is Snap ML seemlessly accelerating scikit-learn applications, but the library's Python API is also compatible with scikit-learn metrics and data preprocessors.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c4d1f91d-9bd5-44c7-a35e-2490116c06da","metadata":{},"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88a393c0-635b-4c67-bc92-3ef19bec509e","metadata":{},"source":["Andreea Anghel\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f91c6fea-9776-43dc-ade8-5f6ce7480f6c","metadata":{},"source":["### Other Contributors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"78a7e364-8ed8-4cf0-bd9b-d65cbe1180a6","metadata":{},"source":["Sangeeth Keeriyadath \n","\n","Joseph Santarcangelo\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"71f6d8b4-51d9-4ec6-9047-62269377772a","metadata":{},"source":["## Change Log\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7f373b7e-7db2-4eb0-aa8a-992d376f2556","metadata":{},"source":["|  Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |  Version | Changed By  |  Change Description |\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","| 2021-08-31  | 0.1  | AAN  |  Created Lab Content |\n","| 2023-01-24  | 0.2  | Anita Verma  |  Reduced data size|\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5cf2dfa5-e74d-441a-b816-7b2d233b940e","metadata":{},"source":[" Copyright &copy; 2021 IBM Corporation.
